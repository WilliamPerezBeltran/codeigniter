<p>Why being able to at least read the code is so important?

Exactly 8 years ago the first iPhone came out and revolutionized the mobile market. Since that day,

the urge to follow new technologies is growing stronger each year. We are living in a world of things

that can communicate with us, and we can communicate back with them. Living in this World of

machines and superior technology generates new desires for communication and human

competencies.</p>
<p>Back in the olden days the most important was to be literate. Looking back at the XVIII century

history and the Industrial Revolution, being literate was the highest quality. Once you knew how to

write and read your life was automatically upgraded. The knowledge was passed via written word –

books, letters, so by being able to read and write one become part of the revolution or at least could

understand the world around him better. Based on this, we can draw a parallel between being

literate in the XVIII century and being technologically literate in XXI century. Being able to read and

write code brings endless possibilities, just like reading and writing did in the past. Nation

increasingly depends on technology and it is adopting new technologies at a breathtaking pace, but

citizens are not equipped to understand the processes, make well­considered decisions or even

think critically about what is happening around them and where does it go. The situation would

change tremendously if people were able to at least read the code. At the moment, 1 % of all

humans are able to make sense of code. Just think for a moment:</p>

  <li>What would be possible and available from the average citizen perspective if 25% of all

citizens were able to do read/write code?</li>
  <li>Already we believe that the pace of technological development is astonishing but is it really?</li>
  <li>Think what would happen if one fourth of people were technologically literate?</li>
   <li>Technological thinking these days is a must, and the sooner we start it, the better it will be for

our understanding of the World, our own safe and the growth.</li>

<pre>...”To achieve a full change of the current paradigm we have to start from the very beginning,

change within an educational system.”</pre>

<pre>Step by step, the programming languages are added to the educational span. Slowly children are

able to understand and write the code, which let them create and explore rather than just use

what is available. ​They are able to think critically about the new technological solutions and analyze

its benefits, potential pitfalls, and risks.</pre>

<pre>
Technology is a part of our everyday routine and we assimilated with it so badly that we cannot

imagine living without it. A good example on how we co­exist with technology is our “relationship”

with smartphones. ... Using your smartphone enable you to communicate with your friends and

family, smart home system, check your finances, book your flight or holidays, play poker, find love

or educate yourself or children. Since applications and technology, in general, are so widespread,

why still only the “chosen” ones can code? We do not expect every person to become a great

developer, but at least understand the code and what is says about the product. Just like now, not

everyone is a writer or a poet, but everyone can read it and understand it to some extent. It would be

really great of the same would apply to understanding the code.</pre>
<pre>
So the findings are that we understand the growing urge for being code literate but the problem lies

in undertaking the critical steps to execute it. People might be more and more conscious about this

particular phenomenon, but decision­makers still haven’t reacted. Possibly they see and

acknowledge the problem, but the whole curriculum change will be very time and money consuming

move. Even though there is a great potential behind the idea, it can take years and years before it

become the reality. Very optimistic stand on this has one of the most recognizable entrepreneurs on

the planet, Mark Zuckerberg: He believes that such a shift in the society should take no longer than

15 years. Let’s hope for it!</pre>
